        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can mandarin oranges, drained, with juice reserved</li>
            <li>¼ cup water, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 (3 ounce) package orange-flavored gelatin (such as Jell-O®)</li>
            <li>1 cup orange soda, chilled</li>
            <li>½ cup frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
            <li>1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Pour reserved mandarin orange juice into a measuring cup. Add enough water to make 3/4 cup. Bring juice mixture to a boil in a saucepan.</li>
            <li>Pour orange-flavored gelatin into a small bowl. Stir in boiling juice mixture until dissolved. Chill until slightly cooled, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir orange soda gently into gelatin mixture. Measure out 1/2 cup gelatin mixture into a bowl. Whisk in whipped topping until smooth. Pour into crust.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate crust until topping is cool, about 15 minutes. Arrange mandarin orange segments on top of the crust. Chill again, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spoon remaining gelatin mixture over the orange segments and refrigerate until firm, about 3 hours.</li>
